/*
Observer Pattern:
1. Its the behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.
2. Its a publish-subscribe design pattern,  this pattern is widely used in event handling systems.
3. Event handling systems: These are asynchronous systems where message communications are sent from producers to subscribers.
4. It is used when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects such that when one object changes state, 
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Pros and Cons:
Pros:
1. Publisher doesn't need to know implementation details of Subscriber. It just knows it has to call ReactToPublisherMsg.
2. Subscriber can be added or removed at runtime without affecting the Publisher.
3. Publisher and Subscriber can be reused across domains (e.g., logging, events, UI updates, etc.)

Cons:
1. subs.(subscriber) in this code breaks abstraction and is unsafe. 
If Subscriber is an interface, you shouldnâ€™t assume the concrete type unless absolutely necessary.
2. If subscribers are not unregistered properly (e.g., via Unregister method), it may lead to memory retention in long-running systems.
3. Notification chains can become difficult to trace, especially when there are many subscribers or nested notifications.
